## About
The purpose of this project is to create a general-purpose tool to process data
being ingested to AWS and intercept personally identifiable information (PII). All
information stored by companies data projects should be for bulk data analysis
only. Consequently, there is a requirement under [GDPR](https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-1-1.pdf/).
to ensure that all data containing information that can be used to identify an individual
should be anonymised.
**This obfuscation tool can be integrated as a library module into a Python codebase.**
**It is expected that the tool will be deployed within the _AWS_ account.**
